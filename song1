Did you stand there all alone			D Dmaj7 Em G A
Oh I cannot, explain whatâ€™s going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out, somewhere else right now

You sigh, look away,
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

[D Dmaj7 Bm Em]

You can drive, all night				Bm D G F#m
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find, peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday 		D Dmaj7 Em G A 
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall

Cigarette, daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet, with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

[D Dmaj7 Bm Em]

You can drive, all night				Bm D G F#m
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find, peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

Doo, do, doo [Em A Em D A] [Em A Em Bm G] [A A]

You can drive, all night				Bm D G F#m
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find, peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring ray
